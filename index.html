          <p>Hello! Iâ€™m Jamie, a Toronto based Product Leader with over a decade of experience in B2C SaaS & a proven track record of success in building and scaling products & 0-1 launches.
          </p>

<p>As a leader, I have 3 years reporting directly to CEO/Co-Founder of Ratehub, heading the product team of a the largest financial comparison platform in Canada with 1 million monthly visitors, and 6 years of overall experience managing and mentoring high-performing teams.</p>

<p>I've led teams launching lean MVPs, to guiding products through growth phases right through to managing established market leaders. Innovation, continuous experimentation, and the pursuit of growth are always at the heart of anything I do. My leadership philosophy is anchored in the success of my team; I thrive when they do. I cultivate a culture of mentorship and a clear, unified vision in order to empower my team to tackle real user problems with data-driven, scientific methods.
</p>

<p>On a personal note, I'm fascinated by the emergence of transformative technologies, particularly AI and LLM. I've applied these tools to innovate within the workplace and, outside, spent a large amount of my own time learning and gaining hands on experience with self hosting models, implementing RAG solutions and playing around with all the open source tools available (Mixtral, LangChain, Ollama etc)

          <h2>About the making of this website</h2>
          <p>
            This website was both coded and designed entirely using ChatGPT &
            it's been a fun pet project to see what it's capable of.
          </p>
          <p>
            While it's produced something functional, as you can see product
            designers and frontend developers probably don't need to find a new
            line of work just yet!
          </p>
          <p>
            If anyone is curious about the making of the site, don't hesitate to
            <a href="#contact">contact me</a>! I'd be happy to share my
            experience and discuss the potential of AI in web design and
            development.
